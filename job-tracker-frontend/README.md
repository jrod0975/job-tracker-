A job tracker app to keep track of how many times you've been rejected!

A job tracker app made with React. It tracks the jobs you applied to. Asks for company name, position, and the status of your job application. You get to view it on an applications list tab where you can filter based on job status. The dashboard lets you view the count and status of your job applications at a glance.

This is the polishing branch.
